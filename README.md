# AWS Reserved Instance Inventory Tool

A desktop application to understand your current inventory of AWS reserved instances and their status on the RI marketplace. The need for this tool arose when we had purchased a large number of RIs and started to sell them on the RI marketplace. The AWS console does not provide a single place to see all your RIs along with their status on the RI marketplace - you would have to go into the EC2 console and scroll through RIs one by one, noting their disposition as you go.

This application allows you see all your RIs, how much they've been utilized over the last 30 days and if they are currently listed on the RI marketplace or have been sold.

## Features

- üîç **Fetch RI Data**: Retrieve Reserved Instance inventory, listings, and utilization data
- üìä **Interactive Table**: Sortable columns with search and filter capabilities  
- üìÅ **Export Functionality**: Save results to CSV with clean formatting
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean, professional interface built with tkinter
- üîí **Secure**: Uses temporary AWS credentials (no storage)
